-=+ II. Building libtorque +=-
----------------------------------------------------------------libtorque-----

libtorque does not employ the GNU autoconf tools, but is reliant upon GNU Make
and the GNU Compiler Collection. gcc is tracked quite closely, and only recent
versions might be supported at any time; 4.3 is the minimum gcc version
explicitly supported or recommended.

On Linux, the GNU C Library is required, using the NPTL threading
implementation.

On FreeBSD, only the libthr threading implementation is explicitly supported or
recommended. If rebuilding world, ensure NO_LIBTHR is not active in make.conf.
Bind libpthread references to libthr via the following /etc/libmap.conf:

	# See libmap.conf(5)

	libpthread.so.2         libthr.so.2
	libpthread.so           libthr.so

If using a 32-bit version of the library on a 64-bit system, place these same
lines in /etc/libmap32.conf. The mapping may be restricted to libtorque if
necessary (the authors recommend general use of the libthr implementation).

From the toplevel, invoke GNU make. On Linux, 'make' is almost always GNU make.
On FreeBSD, the devel/gmake Port supplies GNU make as 'gmake'. This will build
the libtorque library, and run the supplied unit tests. Unit test failures are
promoted to full build failures. The install target can then be run to install
the library.

Note: The 'install' target depends on unit testing targets, and thus will not
install a known-unsafe library. This might be undesirable when hacking on the
library, and testing with another application. The 'unsafe-install' target is
provided to facilitate such operation. Its use is not typically recommended.

The 'deinstall' target will remove the files installed by that version of
libtorque (it cannot remove files installed only by previous versions). Since
libtorque does not install any active configuration files, use of 'deinstall'
is thus recommended prior to updating and rebuilding libtorque. Non-existence
of files is not considered an error by the 'deinstall' target.

libtorque can be brought up to date via 'git pull'. The 'clean' target should
never be necessary to run, save when hacking on the build process itself.
